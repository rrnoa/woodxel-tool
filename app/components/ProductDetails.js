      Transform your cherished images into extraordinary pixel art wooden masterpieces with WoodXEL. Our innovative platform combines cutting-edge 3D modeling technology with traditional woodworking craftsmanship to create unique art pieces that elevate any space.
      </p>

      <p className="product-description">
      Each WoodXEL creation begins with your chosen image, which is then meticulously transformed into a detailed 3D model using our proprietary software. This model guides our skilled artisans as they carefully select, cut, and arrange thousands of precision-milled wooden pixels to recreate your image in exquisite detail.
      </p>

      <p className="product-description">
      We use only the finest hardwoods, including maple, pine, and poplar, sourced from sustainable forests, and non-toxic, acrylic water-based color finishes to ensure that your art piece is as durable as it is beautiful. The natural grain and texture of the wood add depth and character to each pixel, making every WoodXEL creation genuinely one-of-a-kind.

This option includes removable blocks, one in the center of each panel for easy mounting. After securing the panels, simply replace the blocks for a seamless look. We offer free shipping to anywhere in the United States for this option.

This option allows you to match the frame with the one or 2-inch pixel blocks you can also choose. Users pay for the frame and shipping with this option.
